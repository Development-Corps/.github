        ### Discussions and Brainstorming

        For open-ended discussions or brainstorming sessions, we encourage you to use our [Discord server(this is a WIP)](#) or our [GitHub Discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/Development-Corps/discussions).

        This helps keep our issues focused on actionable tasks and bug reports.

        Thank you for your understanding and participation!

      GitHub requires a non-markdown block so this is here.
      That said please read above as this is an issue that will most likely be funnled into the discussions section any way!
